/*
 * The Cray tools interface needs to read environment variables about the system
 * configuration dynamically at run time. The environment variables that are
 * read are defined here.  Note that the value of these environment
 * variables are subject to change. Use the defines to guarantee portability.
 *
 * CTI_LIBAUDIT_ENV_VAR (required)
 *
 *         Used to define the absolute path to the audit library. This is
 *         required to be defined.
 *
 * CTI_LIBAUDIT_KEYFILE_ENV_VAR (optional)
 *
 *         Used to define a path to a file used to create sys-v keys in the 
 *         audit library. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created at the 
 *         provided location. If it is not provided, a default choice will be 
 *         made.
 *
 * CTI_DBG_LOG_DIR_ENV_VAR (optional)
 *
 *         Used to define a path to write log files to. This location must be 
 *         cross mounted and accessible by the compute nodes in order to receive
 *         debug logs from tool daemons.
 *
 * CTI_USER_DEF_APRUN_EXE_ENV_VAR (optional)
 *
 *         Used to define the absolute path to the aprun binary. This is used 
 *         when a site has renamed the real aprun binary to something else.
 *
 * CTI_ATTRIBS_TIMEOUT_ENV_VAR (optional)
 *
 *         Used to define the amount of time the daemon will spend attempting to
 *         open the pmi_attribs file when gathering application pid information
 *         on the compute node. If this is not set, the default timeout period 
 *         is 60 seconds.
 *
 * CTI_EXTRA_SLEEP_ENV_VAR (optional)
 *
 *         Used to define an extra amount of time to sleep after reading the 
 *         pmi_attribs file if it was not immediately available. This is to 
 *         avoid a potential race condition. If this is not set, the default is
 *         to wait an order of magnitude less than the amount of time it took to
 *         open the pmi_attribs file.
 *
 * CTI_CFG_DIR_ENV_VAR (required)
 *
 *         Used to define a location to write internal temporary files and 
 *         directories to. The caller must have write permission inside this 
 *         directory.
 *
 * CTI_DAEMON_STAGE_DIR_ENV_VAR	(optional - CAUTION!)
 *
 *         Used to define the directory root name that will be used to stage 
 *         binaries, libraries, and files to on the compute node. This can be 
 *         used to force multiple sessions to use the same directory structure.
 *         The use of this is not recommended since it is not guarded against 
 *         race conditions and conflicting file names.

 *                        with the provided argv array and have the launcher
 *                        hold the application at its startup barrier for 
 *                        MPI/SHMEM/UPC/CAF applications.
 * 
 * Detail
 *      This function is the preferred way for users to use the tool interface
 *      to launch applications.
 *
 *      The launcher to use will be automatically determined based on the
 *      current workload manager on the system. It is up to the caller to obtain
 *      valid launcher_argv arguments. This interface will simply pass the
 *      arguments through directly to the launcher program. This launcher is
 *      either aprun, srun, or mpirun.
 *
 *      This function will hold the application at its startup barrier until
 *      the barrier release function is called with the app_id returned by this
 *      call. This only applies to applications using programming models that
 *      call some sort of init function (MPI_Init for example).
 *
 *      This function can redirect the stdin of the launcher to a file. This is 
 *      enabled by setting the argument redirectInput to true and providing a 
 *      string that represents the pathname to the file. If redirectInput is 
 *      false, the function will redirect the stdin of the launcher to /dev/null 
 *      to prevent the launcher  from grabbing any input on stdin which may be
 *      used by other tool programs. 
 *
 *      This function can also optionally redirect stdout/stderr to provided
 *      open file descriptors by setting redirectOutput to true (non-zero).
 *
 *      This function can optionally set the current working directory for the 
 *      launcher process. This is useful if the launcher should start somewhere
 *      other than the current PWD if the application creates files based on 
 *      PWD.
 *
 *      This function can optionally set environment variables for the launcher
 *      process. This is useful if the launcher should use an environment
 *      variable that is different than the current value set in the parent.
 *
 * Arguments
 *      launcher_argv -  A null terminated list of arguments to pass directly to
 *                       the launcher. This differs from a traditional argv in
 *                       the sense that launcher_argv[0] is the start of the
 *                       actual arguments passed to the launcher and not the
 *                       name of launcher itself.
 *      redirectOutput - Toggles redirecting launcher stdout/stderr to the
 *                       provided file descriptors.
 *      redirectInput -  Toggles redirecting launcher stdin to the provided file
 *                       name.
 *      stdout_fd -      The open file descriptor to redirect stdout to if 
 *                       redirectOutput evaluates to true.
 *      stderr_fd -      The open file descriptor to redirect stderr to if
 *                       redirectOutput evaluates to true.
 *      inputFile -      The pathname of a file to open and redirect stdin to if
 *                       redirectInput evaluates to true.
 *      chdirPath -      The path to change the current working directory of 
 *                       the launcher to, or NULL if no chdir is to take place.
 *      env_list -       A null terminated list of strings of the form 
 *                       "name=value". The value of name in the environment will
 *                       be set to value irrespective of name already existing
 *                       in the environment.

 *      manifest must be created before calling this function and will be 
 *      cleaned up by this function. A unique directory will be created on the
 *      compute node in the temporary storage space associated with the
 *      application. This avoids naming conflicts between other tools using this
 *      interface. This unique directory will contain subdirectories /bin that
 *      contains all binaries and /lib that contains all libraries. Any files
 *      will not be placed in a subdirectory and are available directly in the
 *      current working directory of the tool daemon. All binaires will be found
 *      in the PATH of the tool daemon process, and all libraries will be found
 *      in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH of the tool daemon process.
 *
 *      A cti_session_id_t can be provided to associate this tool daemon with an
 *      existing tool daemon's environment previously setup on the compute node.
 *      Any libraries or files that were previously shipped will also be
 *      available to the new tool daemon. This can also be used to exec the tool
 *      daemon inside of a previously shipped manifest that was created by the
 *      call to sendManifest(). If a session id is provided, the return value
 *      from this function will be the same session id on success.
 *
 *      If both cti_manifest_id_t and cti_session_id_t arguments are provided,
 *      the manifest must have been created using the same session, otherwise an
 *      error will occur.
 *
 *      If the debug option evaluates to true, daemon launcher will attempt to 
 *      read the environment variable defined by CTI_DBG_LOG_DIR_ENV_VAR and
 *      create a log file at this location. If the environment variable is not
 *      found or is null, it will create a log file in the /tmp directory on the
 *      compute node. It will then dup the STDOUT/STDERR file channels to this
 *      log file. This is the only way to capture stdout/stderr output from a
 *      tool program on the compute nodes.
 *
 * Arguments
 *      app_id -  The cti_app_id_t of the registered application.
 *      mid -     The optional manifest id of a previously created manifest, or
 *                0 if no manifest is required.
 *      sid -     The optional session id of a previously created session, or
 *                0 if no session association should be made.
 *      fstr -    The name of the binary to exec onto the compute nodes.
 *                This can either be a fullpath name to the file or else
 *                the file name if the binary is found within the users
 *                PATH.
 *      args -    The null terminated list of arguments to pass to the
 *                fstr binary upon launch.
 *      env -     The null terminated list of environment variables to
 *                set in the environment of the fstr process. The strings
 *                in this list shall be formed in a "envVar=val" manner.
 *      debug -   If true, create a log file at the location provided by
 *                CTI_DBG_LOG_DIR_ENV_VAR. Redirect stdout/stderr to the log
 *                files fd.
 *
 * Returns
 *      A non-zero cti_session_id_t on success, or else 0 on failure.
