/*
 * The Cray tools interface automatically creates/sets several environment 
 * variables when the dlaunch utility launches the tool daemon on the compute
 * node. They are defined here. Note that the value of these environment
 * variables are subject to change. Use the defines to guarantee portability.
 * These should all be read-only.
 *
 * CTI_SCRATCH_ENV_VAR
 *
 *         The environment variable that is used to denote temporary
 *         storage space. This is set to a location that is guaranteed
 *         to be writable and unique to the instance of the tool daemon.
 *         If temporary storage space is required to be shared between a tool
 *         daemon and the application, the caller should set the value of 
 *         CTI_SCRATCH_ENV_VAR in the environment of aprun and then set
 *         CTI_SCRATCH_ENV_VAR in their tool daemon to the value of 
 *         OLD_SCRATCH_ENV_VAR. If multiple instances of tool daemons need to
 *         share temporary storage space, CTI_SCRATCH_ENV_VAR can be set to the
 *         value of CTI_ROOT_DIR_VAR.
 *
 * CTI_OLD_SCRATCH_ENV_VAR
 *
 *         The environment variable that is used to contain the value of
 *         CTI_SCRATCH_ENV_VAR that was set inside the environment of the aprun
 *         associated with this tool daemon. This is useful if you need to query
 *         the value that was used in conjunction with the environment of the 
 *         application. If CTI_SCRATCH_ENV_VAR was not set in the environment of
 *         aprun, CTI_OLD_SCRATCH_ENV_VAR will not exist in the environment of
 *         the tool daemon.
 *
 * CTI_OLD_CWD_ENV_VAR
 *
 *         The environment variable that is used to contain the value of
 *         current working directory of the aprun associated with this tool
 *         daemon. This is useful if the tool daemon needs to know about the
 *         directory the application is running in to read or write a file.
