 * 
 * Detail
 *      This function is the preferred way for users to use the tool interface
 *      to launch aprun sessions. Its important to note that the argv is not
 *      a traditional argv in the sense that argv[0] is the start of actual

 *
 *      This function will hold the application at its startup barrier until
 *      the barrier release function is called with the apid returned by this

 *
 *      This function can redirect the stdin of aprun to a file in order to
 *      provide arguments to a application. This is enabled by setting the
 *      argument redirectInput to true and providing a string that represents
 *      the pathname to the file. If redirectInput is false, the function will
 *      redirect the stdin of aprun to /dev/null to prevent aprun from grabbing

 *
 *      This function can also optionally redirect stdout/stderr to provided
 *      open file descriptors by setting redirectOutput to true (non-zero).
 *
 *      This function can optionally set the current working directory for the 
 *      aprun process. This is useful if the aprun session should start 
 *      somewhere other than the current PWD if the application creates files. 
 *
 * Arguments
 *      aprun_argv -    A null terminated list of arguments to pass directly
 *                      to aprun. This differs from a traditional argv in the
 *                      sense that aprun_argv[0] is the start of the actual

 *                      itself.
 *      redirectOutput - Toggles redirecting aprun stdout/stderr to the provided
 *                      file descriptors.
 *      redirectInput - Toggles redirecting aprun stdin to the provided file
 *                      name.
 *      stdout_fd -     The open file descriptor to redirect stdout to if 
 *                      redirectOutput evaluates to true.
 *      stderr_fd -     The open file descriptor to redirect stderr to if
 *                      redirectOutput evaluates to true.
 *      inputFile -     The pathname of a file to open and redirect stdin to if
 *                      redirectInput evaluates to true.
 *      chdirPath -     The path to change the current working directory of 
 *                      aprun to, or NULL if no chdir is to take place.
 *
 * Returns
 *      A aprunProc_t pointer that contains the pid of the aprun process as well

 *      library dependencies to compute nodes, and start the shipped binary
 *      using the daemon_launcher wrapper.
 *
 *      The daemon_launcher will take care of setting up the compute node 
 *      environment to ensure that any shared library dependency, file, or
 *      binary that was shipped can be found in PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The
 *      user can also provide a null terminated list of environment variables
 *      they wish to set in the environment of the tool process. This list
 *      shall be formed in a "envVar=val" manner. The arguments to pass to the
 *      tool program are defined by the provided null terminated list of args.
 *      Note that args[0] is the begining of the program arguments and not the
 *      name of the program itself.
 *      
 *      The user can make multiple consecutive calls to this function and any
 *      previously shipped shared library dependency that is also used by the
 *      newest binary will not be redundantly shipped. This interface does
 *      not currently support naming conflicts between files and will refuse to
 *      ship a file with a conflicting name to a previously shipped file.
 *
 *      If the debug option evaluates to true, daemon launcher will attempt to 
 *      read the environment variable defined by DBG_LOG_ENV_VAR and create a
 *      log file at this location. If the environment variable is not found or
 *      is null, it will create a log file in the /tmp directory on the compute
 *      node. It will then dup the STDOUT/STDERR file channels to this log file.
 *      This is the only way to capture stdout/stderr output from a tool program
 *      on the compute nodes.
 *
 * Arguments

 *                the tool program to.

 *                PATH.
 *      args -    The null terminated list of arguments to pass to the
 *                fstr binary upon launch.
 *      env -     The null terminated list of environment variables to
 *                set in the environment of the fstr process. The strings
