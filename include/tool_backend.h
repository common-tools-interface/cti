 * findAppPids - Returns a nodeAppPidList_t struct containing nodeRankPidPair_t

 *               application PEs that reside on the compute node.
 *
 * Detail
 *      This function creates a nodeAppPidList_t struct that contains the number
 *      of PE rank/PE PID pairs that reside on the compute node that the tool
 *      daemon interfacing with this library is running on as well the
 *      nodeRankPidPair_t struct entries that contain the actual rank number
 *      along with the associated pid of the PE. Note that on older systems that
 *      do not create the pmi_attribs file, an older mechanism will be used
 *      which "guesses" the association based on the order in which the pid's
 *      were placed into the job container.
 *
 * Arguments
 *      None.
 *
 * Returns
 *      An nodeAppPidList_t struct that contains the number of PE rank/PE pid
 *      pairings on the node and an array of nodeRankPidPair_t structs that
 *      contain the actual PE rank/PE pid pairings.
