This is a very rudimentary howto on running the avocado tests.

Assumptions/Prerequisites(by no means complete):
    1. You've built the cti repo and created an install directory via the
    configure --prefix=<somewhere>/install command.
    2. You've cd'd to cti/test/function and run make.
    2. You've created a symlink in the install directory to cti/test:
	cd <install>; ln -s <fullpathto test> test
    3. You've rsync'd (make sure to include the -L option) or otherwise copied
    this install directory to your target test environment (I've used jupiter).

To run all of the tests:
    On your target system, cd into your install/test/function directory.
    run ./build_run.sh

To run a single test:
    On your target system, cd into your install/test/function directory and run
    the following command (here we use the CtiInfoTest from the
    cti/test/function/avocado_tests.py):

./avocado-virtual-environment/avocado/bin/avocado run ./avocado_tests.py:CtiInfoTest.test
