# CTI tests in cpe-reframe

These are tests for running with cpe-reframe: https://github.hpe.com/hpcde/cpe-reframe

Rather than a full test suite, right now they are a proof of concept for running CTI tests in reframe.

Copy the `tests` directory onto a system with cpe-reframe, and run the tests with

```
cpe-reframe --test ./tests
```
