# The linking strategy for CTI changes depending on if the CTI rpm is installed system wide
# in /opt/cray/pe or installed elsewhere ("relocated"). The CTI rpm .spec file has logic that
# fills in the "Libs:" line with the appropriate choice depending on the installation style.

# The system wide installation is linked in /opt/cray/pe/lib64, so programs built with the
# system wide version should get their libraries from there.
system_libdir=-L/opt/cray/pe/lib64 -Wl,--enable-new-dtags -Wl,-rpath,/opt/cray/pe/lib64 -Wl,-rpath,/opt/cray/pe/cti/default/lib

# When installed as a relocated rpm, there is no system wide behavior and the programs
# get their libraries directly from the installation directory.
relocated_libdir=-L${libdir}
