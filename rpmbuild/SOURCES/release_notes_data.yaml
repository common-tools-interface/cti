# FORMATTING CONVENTION FOR THIS YAML
## <VARIABLE> - Leave as is. It is automatically updated via spec file.
##
## key:value pairs are used.  
## To include a value that consists of 1 to many elements in a list:
## 1. Itemize each element of a list by prepending with ' - '
##
## To include a value that consists of 1 to many paragraphs:
## 1. The first line of the paragraph must include a vertical bar followed by a return char.
## 2. Itemize each paragraph by prepending with ' - '
## 3. Add your paragragh content including a line break where needed for proper formatting/look.
##    Word wrap is supported.  But may not provide the look and feel you want.  
##    Note that a ':' in your text must be wrapped in quotes for jinja to process it as a string.'
## 4. Spaces are supported for desired formatting for the lines in the paragraph.
## 5. If you have more then 1 paragraph, you can seperate each paragragh with a blank line.
## 6. The prepending "-" for a paragraph should be orange, where the prepending "-" 
##    for a list is white.
##    Or differently colored. It's easier to distinguish the difference if you edit in an editor
##    which supports it.
## 7. The 'static_release_history' key is only temporary.  Upon initial implementation, there likely
##    will be little/no changelog history in the expected format.  Insert 3 of the latest release
##    content, from the previous release notes.  This field, will be removed three releases after
##    the initial implementation, as the expected changelog info will now be available in github
##    history.  If left empty, it will be ignored.  
##    NOTE: Prepend the value with a bar (|) and return. Prepend each line with 2 spaces.

product_description: |
  - Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) is a library that abstracts debugger tool support
    to a common interface regardless of the underlying work load manager. It facilitates
    the staging of files and the launch of tool daemons on the compute nodes associated 
    with a parallel job. Options and interfaces can be found in the cti(1) and cti(3) 
    manpages.

notes: |
  - This is an UNSTABE version built off of the CPE 25.09 release.
    It contains a workaround for an issue where PALS tool daemon launches will fail if
    /tmp is mounted noexec. In this case, set CTI_BACKEND_TMPDIR to a backend directory on
    an executable filesystem.
