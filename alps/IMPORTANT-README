NOTICE:
The ALPS libraries included inside of this directory are custom
modifications of the static libraries found on SLES10 distributions.

They were created to provide a dso mechanism to deal with code changes
between SLES10 and SLES11 SuSE distributions. The symbols used in both
are identical, and thus either of the two can be used for linking and
still have a valid executable. 

Its important to note that these libraries are not supported by the
ALPS group, and they would most likely throw-up if they found out
that they existed. ;)
