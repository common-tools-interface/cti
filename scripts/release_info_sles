CRAY CTI %VERSION%
==========

Release Date:
--------------
%RELEASEDATE%


Product Description:
--------------------
CRAY CTI (Cray Tools Interface) is a library that abstracts debugger
tool support to a common interface regardless of the underlying
work load manager. It facilitates the staging of files and
the launch of tool daemons on the compute nodes associated
with a parallel job.

ALPS and Cray SLURM are the currently supported WLMs.

This is installed primarily for those Cray supplied tools
that need such capabilities. The module is not typically
loaded, but can be for the sake of experimental swapping to
other CTI releases.


Purpose:
---------
  This is a bugfix release.

  1. Change the permissions of the dlaunch binary staged to /tmp on SLURM to
  allow it to be overwritten and cleaned up by other users. Improper
  permissions resulted in a bug where nodes that terminated improperly kept
  dlaunch in /tmp and prevented further launches to that node by users outside
  the original user's group.
