Product Description:
--------------------
CRAY CTI (Cray Tools Interface) is a library that abstracts debugger
tool support to a common interface regardless of the underlying
work load manager. It facilitates the staging of files and
the launch of tool daemons on the compute nodes associated
with a parallel job.

ALPS and Cray SLURM are the currently supported WLMs.

This is installed primarily for those Cray supplied tools
that need such capabilities.

  This is a bugfix release.

  1. Fix an issue related to dlopen of bundled libraries with the generic workload manager
  2. Fix an issue with launching from whiteboxes on slurm
