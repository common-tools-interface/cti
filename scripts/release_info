%RELEASEDATE%


Product Description:
--------------------
  CRAY CTI (Cray Tools Interface) is a library that abstracts debugger
  tool support to a common interface regardless of the underlying
  work load manager. It facilitates the staging of files and
  the launch of tool daemons on the compute nodes associated
  with a parallel job.

  ALPS and Cray SLURM are the currently supported WLMs.

  This is installed primarily for those Cray supplied tools
  that need such capabilities.
