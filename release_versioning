# LIBTOOLS VERSIONING SYSTEM
# --------------------------
# current, revision, and age are a libtools concept. They are completely
# orthogonal to the Cray release version system (which correlates with
# the module name (e.g. cray-cti/1.0.1)), but intertwine with the DSO file
# names.
#
# Libtools flag: -version-info <current>:<revision>:<age>
#
# I am not sure where 'current' shows up, but it is to be incremented
# for any change to the API (and revision zeroed). I think of this as
# being the most recent API definition.
#
# 'revision' should be incremented for any source change whatsoever.
# I think of this as a count of any type of change since the last 
# incompatible change (i.e, 'current' was incremented).
#
# 'age' should be incremented if any interfaces have been added, but
# zeroed if interfaces were removed or changed. I think if this as a 
# count of API extensions since the last incompatible change (i.e, 
# 'current' was incremented).
#
# DSO FILE NAMES:
# ---------------
# The file names of the DSO files are:
#    libcraytools_fe.so.<craytool_major>.<fe_age>.<fe_revision>
#    libcraytools_be.so.<craytool_major>.<be_age>.<be_revision>
#
# One can loosely think of 'major' as indicating incompatible API changes.
# 'age' as API extensions, and 'revision' as bug fixes
# that do not change the API 
#
# RELEASE VERSION
# ---------------
# I think that 'major' and 'minor' are also used to create CRAYTOOL_RELEASE
# 'minor' should probably be set to match fe_revision.
